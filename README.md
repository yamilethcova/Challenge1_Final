# Challenge_Final
This is Yamileth Cova 1st challenge 

I have an issue with the charts, hope you will be able to see them, they tend to change the color and go transparent, but if you only make a chamnge into the pivot table my chart will appear! sorry for this last minute issue but I try to make it fix it with askBCS, friends, others students with mac and when i thought it was done, they disappear today
